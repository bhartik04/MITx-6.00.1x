Problem 1:
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s.

Problem 2:
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s.

Problem 3:
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh
In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc

Problem 4:
